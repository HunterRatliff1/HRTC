<h2>How this app works</h2>





<h3>Sidebar</h3>
<p>
  The sidebar (to the left) can be used to filter the data displayed across the app. 
  <b>Any active filters will apply ACROSS THE <i>WHOLE APP</i></b>. Keep this in mind
  as filtering in this sidebar might prevent data from loading elsewhere (e.g. filtering
  out all of the <code>Question Type</code> = <code>Quiz</code> questions prevent the graph from loading
  on the Questions page if the <code>Message</code> selected under "Select Text Message"
  is a quiz)
</p>
<p>
  Towards the bottom of the sidebar is there is an option to <b>filter by</b> certain 
  variables (e.g. gender, race, grade). Selecting the variable on the <i>filter by</i>
  dropdown allows you to filter by that variable in the box below. Changing the <i>filter by</i>
  selection (e.g. from gender to race) clears the previous filter (in this case, gender),
  preventing the user from filtering down to groups small enough to reveal potentially identifying
  information (e.g. 10th grade black males from FBISD).
</p>

<h3>Descriptive Statistics page</h3>
<p>
  This page is pretty straightforward, as it shows the composition of the users in the campaign
  by demographic groups. It includes options to fliter out people who didn't respond to 
  the demographic questions (i.e. <code>NA</code>), as well as an option to include/exclude
  users who have opted out of the campaign.
</p>

<h3>Have Answer page</h3>
<div class="well">
  <h4>Types of messages <small>("Question types")</small></h4>
  <p>
    Broadly, there are a few categories of message to be aware of when viewing data from this app.
  </p>
  <p>
    Much of this app focuses on text messages sent to users that have a "correct answer", such as 
    <b>quizzes</b> (<i>Your partner stops by your job despite telling them that it made you uncomfortable.
    Is this 1-healthy, 2-unhealthy, or 3-abusive?</i>) or <b>T/F</b> (<i>Fact or Crap? As long as your 
    partner is not hurting you or calling you names, your relationship is healthy. Reply 1-Fact or 2-Crap</i>).
  </p>
  <p>
    Some texts have an optional response (e.g. <b>Knowledge w/ EX</b>, <b>Hotline</b>) where users are asked to reply with
    "1" to receive another message with more info / an example. These questions do not have a "correct answer" and may not
    be included in figures/tables.

<h3>Questions page</h3>
<p>
  This tab shows the detailed responses for each message. Messages are selected
  using the <b>Select Text Message</b> dropdown, with the available reponse 
  message(s) populating below, if applicable.
</p>
<p>
  The response data is displayed on the tabs below, both as a graph and a table.
  On the graph tab, a dropdown can facet the graph by select variables to further
  explore how responses differed among these groups
